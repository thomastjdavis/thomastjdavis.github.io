Browser implementation of a cli star trek game.

URL1: thomastjdavis.github.io/demos/starTrekDemos/board.html
URL2: thomastjdavis.github.io/demos/starTrekDemos/board-grid.html

Styles are in ./styles
Different js files in ./scripts

The grid implementation works, and needs some basic game logic. 

The first (using Canvas) does not work too well - I probably will scrap it, though I can draw lines much easier there.

I will implement these in React eventually, I just wanted a skeleton first.
